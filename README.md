# Primitive Renderer

## A simple tool to view .OBJ files

### Description
This was an exam project made over the course of a few weeks. It was choosen due to it's small size yet diverse challage during it's creation. It uses an implementation of the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm for rendering triangles.

### Usage
Clone the project localy and compile it using your prefered C compiler. 
Upon running the program it will ask for a .obj file, specify it's path relative to the directory of the program.

Press 'H' to open a small UI listing all of the controlls

### Restrictions
The project saves the parsed values from the .obj file in the C stack, so beware stack overflow in case of larger meshes.
The project also utilises functions from the termios.h and unistd.h headers so a UNIX-flavoured system is required.
